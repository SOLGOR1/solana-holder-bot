    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">💧 Reinvesting Earnings into $LEEK: A Win for Everyone</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
      Here’s something exciting: <strong>Solana Holder Bot</strong> is proudly developed by the <strong>LEEK Team</strong>, the creators of the $LEEK project. This means that all earnings from Solana Holder Bot are reinvested directly into <strong>$LEEK liquidity</strong>. Why does this matter? More liquidity leads to bigger arbitrage trades, a stronger burn mechanism, and a healthier ecosystem for $LEEK—benefits that trickle down to everyone involved, including users of Solana Holder Bot!
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">

    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
      If you’re new to $LEEK, let’s break it down. <strong>$LEEK</strong> is more than just a memecoin—it’s a fully autonomous system designed by the LEEK Team to create long-term value for holders. Unlike many tokens that rely solely on hype, $LEEK is built with sustainable mechanics that benefit holders over time. Here’s what makes $LEEK stand out:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-none space-y-2 text-gray-300 mb-4">
      <li class="flex items-start">
        <span class="text-blue-400 mr-2">🔥</span> <strong>Daily Token Burn:</strong> We burn ~5,000 LEEK tokens every day, reducing the total supply and increasing scarcity. This deflationary mechanism helps drive up the value of $LEEK over time.

        <span class="text-blue-400 mr-2">💰</span> <strong>Top 50 Holder Rewards:</strong> The top 50 $LEEK holders receive SOL payouts from ecosystem fees, rewarding loyalty and encouraging long-term holding.

      Our revenue model is what powers this system:
    </p>

      <li class="flex items-start">
        <span class="text-blue-400 mr-2">✅</span> 1% Buy/Sell Fee on the Meteora Pool, which funds burns and rewards.
      </li>
      <li class="flex items-start">
        <span class="text-blue-400 mr-2">✅</span> Liquidity Pools & Auto-Arbitrage across SOL/LEEK, BTC/LEEK, and USDC/LEEK pairs, ensuring stability and growth.
